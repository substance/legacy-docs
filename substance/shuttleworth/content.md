Content providers across all domains (scientific publishing, news, education, book publishing) are facing the very same challenges when it comes to implementing an effective digital publishing workflow.
There are problems to be addressed from the initial stage of content creation, the review process, and upon the final publication of a digital document.

<!-- evtl. keine sub-sections, um Platz zu sparen? -->

### Content creation

<!--
- authors use proprietary editors
- closed document formats make further processing difficult
- proprietary editors do not support collaborative editing, and exchange of thoughts
- publishers have to apply time-consuming manual conversions
-->

Authors are usually drafting their articles in proprietary tools on the desktop, e.g. *MS Word*.
As these editing tools are not tailored for specific target domains, such as scientific publishing,
created documents can not directly be used for an automated publishing workflow.
Moreover, proprietary editing environments obstruct interaction between authors
as they are lacking support for collaborative editing and a means to share thoughts via annotations or comments.

### Peer Review

<!--
- review is important for assuring quality of publications
- a peer review is a process which demands a sophisticated management:
    - to dispatch work to reviewers,
    - collect their evaluations and
    - come to a final decision for acceptance
- reviewers work using the original submitted documents
- reviewers do evaluations offline
- communication between editors and reviewers (and editors and authors) done via eMail
- lack of annotations and comments inhibits a fluent, iterative and integrated workflow
- we suppose: main reason for low number of iterations, i.e., resulting in high number of errors
-->

Publishers have to review author submissions to ensure a constant quality of publications.
In the scientific domain this is done by a adopting a peer review process
which demands a sophisticated management to dispatch submissions to reviewers,
to collect reviewer evaluations and to derive a fair decision regarding the acceptance of a proposal.
Reviewers typically are provided with the original documents as received from authors
and do their evaluations offline.
The communication between editors and reviewers, as well as, between editors and authors,
is usually done via eMail.
Incompatibility of tools and lack of means for comments and annotations prevent
a fluent, integrated workflow.
Despite of being cumbersome and costly, I think that the inconvenience of this workflow
is a major reason for the low number of review iterations observed in reality,
resulting in a rather high number of errors in the final result.


### Publishing

<!--
- challenge: multi-channel publishing (print, PDF, HTML)
- presentation-centric document formats make it hard to foster multi-channel output
- instead manual conversion of documents for each output channel (costly, time-consuming, error prone)
- lack of easy way to reach mobile devices (such as tablets)
-->

Publishers are facing a great challenge needing to serve publications not only as printed media
but also in a digital version.
Additionally, they need to make them accessible on their web-sites.
Presentation-centric document formats, such as PDF or HTML, make it hard to foster automation of generating multi-channel output.
Mostly, great manual effort is expended to prepare documents for different output channels.
This is costly, time-consuming and in the end prone to errors.

### Reading

<!--
- still: no digital presentation being competetive to paper
- poor experience on mobile devices
- no commenting - no discussion
- no way to manage custom annotations
- existing digital publication sites provide discussion facilities but poorely integrated
  into an competitive reading experience
    - inhibits evolution of a post-publishing review culture
-->

There is still no digital presentation format which is as accepted as publications printed on paper.
In my opinion, currently available readers do not exploit the full potential of digital documents.
Such readers very much resemble the classical paper based presentation and
do not provide an integration for creating comments and annotations for personal use
and or to share thoughts with other readers to foster collaborations and post-publishing reviewing.

<!--
### Conclusion
IMO we should use the part 'What do you want to change?' to sketch a vision which
at the same time is conclusive.
-->


What change do you want to make
---------------------------------------------------------------------

<!--
- authors should be provided with an editor that supports:
    - integrated support for annotations and comments (collaboration)
    - annotations for creating personal notes
    - collaborative editing
    - versioning
- submission to publishers should be simplified (1 click)
- simplify peer-review process providing integrated annotations and comments
- improve overall publishing workflow fostering a more iterative approach
- improve multi-channel digital publishing (web, ebook readers, mobile)
- Print in collaboration with typesetters who can also consume the pure content representation
- generalized document model would generally improve processing of documents
    - e.g., scientific aggregators (ResearchGate, PubMed) could easily query data of the publication and reference it
-->

We'd like to reduce the obstacles that originate from economic competition between publishers
and pave the way to true open publishing fostering the idea of open knowledge and open data by exposing documents as little data containers that can be queried and manipulated by web-clients, even when disconnected from the internet.

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1N1ZuBVdeevatrMkn8cnJIbvmuwxeTOcOAd3lURTnyXY/pub?w=960&amp;h=720)

With Substance we'd like to provide a universal framework for digital document manipulation that is completely open, extensible by design and easy to integrate into existing workflows.

<!--

-->

### Content creation

<!--
- web-based editor
- also available on mobile devices
- support for annotations and comments and collaborative editing
- integration into systems of publishers for easy, one-click publishing
-->

We will provide a web-based text editor for authors to create content
following the principle of *semantic editing*.
Authors can instantly collaborate with co-authors using annontations and comments.
Using an application available for PC and mobile devices,
they can work offline and sychronize their changes at a later time
having access to the full history of changes made to the document.
Submitting manuscripts to publishers is made possible with a single click.

### Peer-review

<!--
- publishers can integrate the same technology into their peer-review systems
- reviewers can use comments and annotations for writing evaluations
  directly on a submitted document
- editors can easily manage the reviewing process and have a comfortable way
  to evolve a final decision
- editors can much easier provide authors with instant feedback
- allows a more iterative reviewing process leading to a higher quality of the final publication
-->

Publishers can integrate the same technology into their peer-review system.
Reviewers create evaluations adding comments and annotations directly to a submitted document.
For editors it will be much easier to manage the review process, having evaluations displayed
directly with a document.
The tight integration of authoring tools into the process allows editors to provide authors with instant feedback.
A more iterative reviewing process is possible
which at the end will lead to a higher quality of the final publications.

### Publishing

<!--
- improved document model allows to simplify creating multi-channel output
- optimization of the typesetting process
- automatic conversion to PDF, HTML and mobile formats
-->
A simple document model forms the basis for creating tools to address different output channels.
Not only the process of typesetting can be optimized greatly,
also digital document formats (PDF, HTML, epub) can be created using a common technology
and consumer devices (such as mobiles and tablets) can be reached easily.

### Reading

<!--
- new reading experience exploiting the potential of digitial documents (cross references, multi-media content, etc.)
- can be integrated into publishers web-site
- also available as application for reading offline e.g. on mobile devices
- integrated commenting system establishes a direct channel between authors and readers
- establish a culture of post-publishing review further improving the quality
-
-->
We will create a new reading experience exploiting the full potential of digitial media (cross references, multi-media content, etc.).
This will eventually establish a truely competitive alternative to publications printed on paper increasing the acceptance of digital publications in general.
In addition to a web-based reader, there will be a consumer application which allows reading
documents offline.
An integrated support for annotations and comments, allows users to create personal notes easily
and furthermore establishes a direct channel between authors and readers.
Creating such a means for communication and interaction will foster a post-publishing review
process and contribute to further improvement of publications.

### Impact

<!--
Promo video emphasizes following problem domains:
- telecommunications: does not fit (?)
- open-science: major focus of proposal
- open-data:
    - open data could be used for interactive visualisations in publications
    - published documents can be accessed programmatically, contributing to Open-Data itself
- philantropy: does not fit (?) - what is this actually?
- education:
    - scholarly domain
    - application for creating teaching and learning material
    - application for viewing and work interactively with education material
- government transparency

-->

Substance is desgined to be adaptable to other domains easily
building a foundation for comparable systems in other interesting problem domains.

Beyond the open-science community, we see an instant benefit for the open-data domain,
and a similar potential for the scholarly domain and the open-government community.
Publications provided as Substance documents can be processed and queried via a simple Javascript API,
thus contributing directly to the open-data community.

In the same way as for the publishing use-case it is possible to create a system for the
scholarly domain. The documents would contain teaching and learning material which could
be edited by teaching staff. Students could use a web-based interface or a locally installed application for learning and doing exercises or homework.
Again facilities for comments and annotations could foster social interaction and exchange
of knowledge, and eventually improve the quality of education material.

A very similar use-case we have found in the area of open-democracy.
In the legislative, bills undergo an iterative development process,
being discussed by law experts as well as by common citizens.
Tools for presentation and editing are again not available and could benefit greatly from features of digital media and a means for communication and collaboration.

What do you want to explore?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- keep it short -->

<!--(A description of the innovations or questions you would like to explore during the fellowship year)-->

<!-- primary exploration fields -->

### Primary exploration fields

#### Document Model

As outlined before the main issue with digital publishing lies in the vast of incompatible proprietory document formats and editors. To address this we are exploring the possibilities of a pure browser-based interface for digital documents with a focus on customizability. It serves as a common ground for customized publishing workflows. Web-based editors are much easier to implement when they can operate on a browser-native datastructure. Moreover, we claim that HTML is not a suitable document representation format. Nested tags lead to a mix of content and presentation. HTML isn't strict enough to allow reliable structural reasoning, and thus makes implementing editors nearly impossible. With the Substance Document Model we store plain text and annotations (emphasis, link, comment) separately and provide an easy to use API, that web-based readers and editors can utilize.

#### Interactive Reading

We would like to explore the possibilities of interactive reading experiences that take full advantage of the opportunities offered by digital media. We'd like increase the popularity of working with digital publications, by utlizing its strengths. The ultimate goal is the development of a reading interface that provides an equal or even better reading experience than printed paper. Moreover, we'd like to encourage publishers to switch to an improved document input format which can be processed by web-browsers in different ways.

<!--
- increases popularity of working with digital publications
- increases the acceptance on the side of readers (scientists)
- encourages publishers to switch to an improved document input format which
- can be processed by Web-browsers
 -->


#### Open Collaboration

Open collaboration is an important field I would like to explore. While there are existing solutions for annotating web-content, they aren't yet frequently used, mostly because of usability and integration issues. There's consensus that for optimal usage, commenting systems need to be integrated tightly with the reading experience.

### Extended exploration fields

*The following goals are ultimate goals of the Substance platform. Other than the goals mentioned above, which are totally realizable within the period of the fellowship, the following items should be considered ambitious long-term goals, taking into account the time people need to accept fundamental technology transitions.*

#### Editing

With `Substance.Document` and `Substance.Surface` we are creating new building blocks for web-based content editors, that operate on a JSON data-structure rather than HTML.

This approach ensures pure separation of content and layout and makes developing web-based editors much easier. There is support for incremental updates and versioning that editor-vendors can use out of the box. Substance is the only open project delivering a web-native document format intended for editors. I'd like to take this idea further during the fellowship and connect with providers of existing editors (FidusWriter, Aloha, OER Editor) to help them integrate with our content platform.

#### Peer to peer architecture

With Substance we'd like to move away from a pure centralized architecture. We'd like to setup an environment that works decentralized, in a similar fashion to Git. Many organizations aren't using hosted tools (such as Google Docs) due to privacy issues. My vision sees all clients to hold their own document repository, which they can share with trusted peers. Implementing distributed systems is a challening task. However with Substance we have many building blocks in place already. Given the curernt situation on the market, I believe there's a true need to distributed document management solutions where users can have full control about their content.


#### Import / Export

Substance provides a simple framework for import and export tasks, so the proposed document model can be integrated with existing technologies in both ways. We do have implemented support for the JATS XML standard for instance. I'd like to add support for more input and output formats formats when there is a demand (e.g. ePub, PDF, DOCX, ODT, ...).


What are you going to do to get there?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- (A description of what you actually plan to do during the year) -->

### Document Model

<!-- Defining -->

With the Substance Document Model we are defining an open framework for manipulating structured digital documents in the browser. It is designed to ensure consistency, stricly separates content from presentation and provides an easy to use API. This abstract model serves as an interface for custom document models, that can be defined by domain experts. The Substance Document Model is unique in that it doesn't require any server side infrastructure, which makes it really easy to integarte into exisiting systems. Using the provided API users can create content elements and **annotate** them in various ways. We also have implemented support for *incremental changes* and *versioning*, which is crucial for implementing *collaborative workflows*. During the fellowship, I will further improve this framework and turn it into a reliable production system. I will also put an emphasis on *customization*, so that configuring a new document flavor becomes very easy.


### Interactive Reading

<!-- Implementing an -->

The web browser provides a unified platform for viewing content. Instead of binding the content to a presentation-focused format, we can view the content as data and build a new generation of tools.

[eLife Lens](http://lens.substance.io) is just one example that demonstrates what today's modern browsers are capable of. I'd like to continue with that work, creating a highly customizable reading environment optimized for digital content, ready to be integrated into production workflows. While eLife Lens was primarily focused on scientific content, the new Substance Reader will fit more general usecases as well. The reader will be designed to support desktops (2-panel view) and mobile (details on demand). Customization will be possible without touching the codebase. For instance, if you wanted to display interactive visualizations along with your content, you'd have to configure a custom article format. Since the Substance reader implements a defined interface, it can display different article types at the same time. This is also important with respect to supporting legacy content. E.g. if you make breaking changes to your article configuration, you can still support legacy content through the original article definition.

### Open Collaboration

I'd like to utilize our experience from building Substance and eLife Lens and implement a functioning prototype within the period of the fellowship. With further financial support from publishers we'd like to help them integrating our system into their journal websites. During this year my main focus will lie in the development of a pluggable user interface that can be activated for the Substance Reader. I'd like to keep my focus on the front-end bits, exploring a collaboration with [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is) using their API's for storing annotations as an overlay. Lastly I'd like to integrate the commenting system into a real test bed, working together with [eLife](http://elifesciences.org) and other publishers.


<!-- ### Open Collaboration

Collaborative features such as annotations and comments, as well as private notes can be built right into reading environments.  -->

#  Background information

<!--Please provide responses to the background information questions and demographic data below. The responses to the questions should not exceed 2 typed pages in total.   Some of the questions may not be applicable to your circumstances. If that is the case please indicate that.-->

## Have you started implementation of the idea?


<!--If so, please provide details on organisational structure, life cycle and progress.-->

Yes. I started prototyping the original idea in late 2010. Since then many hours have flown into the development of the Substance platform and many of the core problems associated with browser-based document manipulation have already been solved. Substance is developed as an Open Source project. It's currently maintained by myself and Oliver Buchtala. However there have been many contributions from the Open Source community so far. Here's a selection of the most important components we've already designed and implemented:

### Substance Article

The Substance Article serves as a reference implementation for Substance-based document formats. In the current version there is support for most common content types, such as paragraphs, headings, images, lists and tables. It provides a document manipulation API for Javascript as well as view compontents + default styles, individually for each content type.

It can be adapted easily by users. One example is the [Lens Document Format](http://lens.substance.io/#lens/lens_article), which shares 80% of the Substance.Article's content element but adds support for domain specific content, such as rich figures, citations and supplemental materials.



### Substance Chronicle

[Substance.Chronicle](http://substance.io/#substance/manual/toc/header_15) is a git-inspired versioning API based on Operational Transformations. It allows versioning of document operations, allowing for collaborative workflows that work offline and online.

### Substance IO

Our website [Substance.io](http://substance.io) is powered by a simple minimal publishing system, [IO](http://substance.io/#substance/publish). It lets users write an article in Markdown and define figures, tables etc. in a simple JSON syntax. All that [input](https://github.com/substance/docs/tree/master/substance) is compiled into a full-fledged Substance Article including the main content, meta information such as title and authors including also figures you have specified. It works similarly to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator written in Ruby. Compiled IO document repositories can be hosted on any webserver. It's only a folder containing static HTML and Javascript files.



## Who are your current or potential key partners?

I'm working closely with Oliver Buchtala, who is involved in core-development and implemented some critical components such as Versioning, Operational Transformation and the Substance Document Model.

In 2013 we were collaborating with Open Access publishers and have implemented a new way to display scientific content, [eLife Lens](http://lens.substance.io). This tool is built on top of the Substance technology stack and has been successfully integrated by [eLife](http://elifesciences.org) and [Landes Bioscience](http://www.landesbioscience.com/). My key partners here are:

- Ivan Grubisic (UC Berkeley graduate student)
- Ian Mulvany (Head of Technology at eLife)

## Do you intend to implement the idea as a for-profit or not-for-profit initiative in the future?

Substance will remain fully Open Source, and therefore primarily live in a not-for-profit space.

## Where will you be based during a potential fellowship?

Linz, Austria

## Do you have an online presence? Please provide links.

# Describe the world as it is

For better illustration let us evaluate the status quo by looking at a typical workflow that a scientific publisher may have implemented.

## Publishing

Working with digital documents has been difficult, primarily because they come in presentation-centric formats with the goal of appearing identical across multiple devices for printing purposes.
Content today, however, is no longer being printed out readily.
Instead, it is being read on a variety of platforms, from computers to tablets and other mobile devices.
Although optimized for print, when presented with different screen sizes and other device inconsistencies
traditional digital publishing formats lack key features that could otherwise improve readers' ability to focus on an author's arguments.
Again, a lot of manual work is put into optimizing content for display on different devices.

## Conclusion

root of problems:
- proprietary, closed document formats which are presentation-centric
- lack of a reading experience
    - for digital publications that is competetive to paper
    - with support for annotations and comments
- huge gap between input and output formats
- wenn wir ein datenformat hätten könnten endgeräte sich selbst um die darstellung kümmern
- slow, error-prone publishing workflows

TODO: wie könnten folgende Aspekte in die Diskussion eingebracht werden
- customization (other problem domains, branding)
- fostering idea of Open Access and Open Data

There's a huge gap between input and output formats, which leads to slow and error-prone publishing workflows. A gap that needs to be filled so that publishing systems can be built around a single source of information, a digital representation of the article, storing only the contents excluding layout information.

There are no existing solutions addressing the critical parts of the problem space that I am aware of. Many tools being built today are addressing the symptoms resulting from that gap, rather than tackling the real source of the problem.

We need to think about a fresh approach on how a digital document can be represented in the future. Like most people, I agree that such a model must be deeply integrated into the web-platform.

Due to a variety of formats used by organizations there are high costs for document creation and processing (tools are incompatible). So interoperability is a core issue. What the world needs is probably not another standard that tries to fit it all.Many attempts (e.g. around XML) were failing in the past.


# What change do you want to make?

The content of Substance based documents can be queried and processed using a simple Javascript API.
This makes it easy for public aggregators to create services on top of a document base
provided by open-access publishers.

## Use-Cases / Impact

These use-cases have been replaced in favour for ones which are mentioned in the SF promo video:
- *Journalists* could use an integrated toolchain to draft stories, have them reviewed and after publishing with a click, they can interact with readers through the built-in annotation and commenting system.
- Since Substance doesn't depend on any infrastructure it can be used to power a private *document cloud* for organizations.
