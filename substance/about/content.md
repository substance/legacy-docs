# Introduction

Substance provides an extensive, customizable content creation and annotation framework that enables user-centric interfaces and automatic data processing via your web-browser. Thanks to its modular nature it creates an ideal environment for many integration scenarios. Substance is completely free and [open source](http://github.com/substance).

To get started we recommend that you read through our [Manual](#substance/manual) and follow the instructions in the official [Tutorial](#substance/tutorial). 

Substance is built around the following core ideas:

## Semantic editing

Unlike traditional word-processors, Substance focusses on content, by leaving the layout part to the system not the user. Because of the abscence of formatting utilities, it suggests structured, content-oriented writing.

## Content is data

Substance considers content as data, which allows digital documents to be queried like a database. With little effort, you can take the Substance data format and display it the way you want.

## Open Collaboration

Substance targets open collaboration. Everyone should be able to contribute to a document, without the hurdles.

Consider the following document:

Wouldn't it be nice to just express your feelings right away?

Substance offers inline annotations (markers) as well as comments to allow exactly that.

## Extensible

There's no one size fits it all solution. Hence we defined a simple plugin system to make it easy for developers to create their own content types and share them with the Substance development community.

## Open Source

Behind the scenes the Substance is mainly composed by a stack of open source modules that will be publicly released under the Open Source MIT license.

## eLife Lens

We are collaborating with Open Access publishers and have implemented a new way to display scientific content, eLife Lens. This tool is built on top of the Substance technology stack and has been successfully integrated by  eLife and Landes Bioscience.

# Work with us

Do you see Substance fit for your business use-case? Contact us at [info@substance.io](mailto:info@substance.io). We're happy to discuss options how Substance can be integrated with your application use-cases.

# Contribute

We’ve been developing Substance for three years now with almost no funding, making this a project mainly built out of voluntary effort. Anyway, our ambitious goal is making Substance an open de-facto-standard for interoperable digital publishing.

You can report bugs and discuss features on [GitHub](http://github.com/substance), on Freenode in the `#_substance` IRC channel, or send tweets to [@_substance](http://twitter.com/_substance).
And if that's not enough, post to our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/substance_).

# Thanks

We'd like to thank anybody who supported the project from the beginning. We've received code contributions from people all over the world. Among them (in chronological order) [Samo Korosec](http://dribbble.com/froodee), [Tim Baumann](https://github.com/timjb), [Victor Saiz](https://github.com/vectorsize) and [Daniel Beilinson](https://github.com/Integral). They all helped to shape the idea and implementation.

Our most recent work was backed by a [Shuttleworth](http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/) Flash Grant that we received earlier this year.

We'd also like to thank anyone who supported our [Pledgie campaign](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/18902). The bad news is we didn't reach our funding goal. The good news is we got the proposed release ready anyway. We were working hard on the past 6 months and reimplemented Substance from scratch. A solid foundation is now ready, paving the way for exciting use-cases and applications.
